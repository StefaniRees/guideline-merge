## Objective
Quickly revert the integration when necessary, preserving traceability and recording the incident for organizational learning.

## Inputs (Required Artifacts)
- Rollback plan available
- Previous commit or version identified

## Outputs (Produced Artifacts)
- Integration reverted
- [Incident Record](/docs/artifacts/historico-conflitos)

## Roles
- **[Developer A](/docs/roles/developer-principal)** — executes the reversion and records the incident
- **[Developer B](/docs/roles/developer-integrador)** — supports the reversion execution
- **[Mediator](/docs/roles/mediador)** — coordinates the reversion process and ensures traceability

## Activities
1. Execute reversion in a controlled and auditable manner
2. Record incident with causes, impact, and decisions made
3. Perform post-failure analysis

## Entry Criteria
- Incident or risk identified that justifies the reversion

## Exit Criteria (Gate)
- Reversion executed + incident record completed

## Quality Gate
**[Rollback Strategy](/docs/guidelines/rollback-strategy)** — reversion executed in a controlled manner with incident record and post-failure analysis before closing the cycle.

## Tools
- [Version Control](/docs/tools)
